.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]dynaspy\f[R] writes to standard error the names of shared libraries
used by a program as the program opens them.
It uses \f[I]ptrace\f[R] to watch all system calls made by the
application.
Any variation of the \f[I]open()\f[R] syscall has the corresponding
filename opened and checked to see if it is a dynamic library by
examining the file header.
